# Introduction

Data science is like storytellingâ€”it involves making sense out of numbers and revealing the narratives hidden within data. In today's data-driven world, data is the foundation of any successful company. Analyzing and interpreting data has never been more crucial.

### Analysis vs. Analytics

- **Analysis:** Analysis involves examining data from past events to understand how and why something happened. It's retrospective and explanatory, helping to answer questions such as why a story ended a certain way. Analysis can be both qualitative (non-numerical insights) and quantitative (numerical insights).

- **Analytics:** Analytics, on the other hand, is forward-looking. It uses data to predict and explore potential future events. There are two main types of analytics: `Qualitative Analytics` uses intuition and insights derived from past analyses to inform future business strategies and decisions. `Quantitative Analytics` involves applying mathematical formulas and algorithms to data collected from past analyses to predict future trends and outcomes.

However the following formula applies in the data science world:

**Analytics = Analysis + Analytics**

### Business Intelligence (BI)

The process of analysing and reporting historical business data. After reports and dashboards have been prepared they can be used  to make informed, strategic and tactical decisions by end users such as the general manager. Concisely put, BI aims to explain past business events using past data.

### Machine Learning

ML is the ability of machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed. ML is about creating and implementing algorithms that let machines receive data and use this data to:
- make predictions
- analyse patterns
- give recommendations

### Artificial Intelligence

Simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers.
